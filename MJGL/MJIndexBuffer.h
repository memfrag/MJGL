/**
 * The MJIndexBuffer object wraps a number of OpenGL calls for creating
 * "index buffer objects" (IBOs). An IBO is a memory buffer, controlled by
 * the OpenGL driver, where index data is stored. This allows the OpenGL
 * driver to store index data in a suitable area, such as video memory.
 *
 * Each index in the buffer points to a particular vertex in a vertex
 * buffer. It allows for reuse of vertices without storing several
 * instances of the same vertex.
